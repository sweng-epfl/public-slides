# Software Engineering slides

> [!WARNING]
> The slides for Performance, Teamwork, and Security are not yet ready for public consumption but will be added soon.

This repo contains PowerPoint slides for the Software Engineering course given at EPFL, and the template used for all of them.

See the [course repo](https://github.com/sweng-epfl/public) for more details.


## Format

All text should be at least 40pt, except code which can be in 36pt Consolas since that font is "large" and it thus looks roughly like 40pt Calibri.

Emphasis:
- Underline key points
- Highlight in yellow #FFFF00 key changes from a previous slide

Code, using the 2nd darkest variations from PowerPoint's color palette given the colors above:
- Blue keywords
- Yellow class names
- Red literals
- Green comments
- 2 spaces for indents

Images:
- Use vector images if possible, especially for icons
- Use images that do not require crediting if at all possible, otherwise add a source on the slide
- For lecture notes, keep in mind they might be viewed in light or dark mode, and thus should look good on both white and black backgrounds

Shapes:
- Use either an outline or a fill, but not both unless there's a good reason
- Do not use emojis, because they look different on different OSes and OS versions

Sections:
- Use one PowerPoint section per logical section
- Start each section with a "section title" slide
- Sections should be focused on a specific objective, usually in the form of a question
- If a section can be summarized as "here is some stuff to know", this means it lacks a clear objective and should be rephrased

Overall:
- For in-lecture exercises, include slide notes with their expected duration
- Minimize the amount of text and especially minimize the number of text-only slides
- Avoid slide transitions unless there is a good reason
- Slides start with a title slide, lead-in slides, then an "Objectives" slide
- Slides end with a "Summary" slide
